### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is my personal website. I use it to host my CV <a href="https://github.com/philiphanspach/philiphanspach.github.io/tree/master/files/Academic_CV_ph.pdf" download> [click to download]</a> and things that I have written. If anything catches your interest, or if you would like to discuss any of the topics or texts on this website, feel free to get in touch. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching market power in digital markets and the role of Internet infrastructure.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about economics, crÃªpes recipes, places to go in Florence, Italy.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about competition law enforcement and the EU bubble in Brussels.

Use the links at the top to see my research projects and papers, my teaching experience, and a CV.
