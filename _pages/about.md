### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Philip Hanspach, a PhD candidate in economics at European University Institute, Florence. My research interests are industrial organization, competition policy and economics of AI. On this website, you can find my CV <a href="https://github.com/philiphanspach/philiphanspach.github.io/tree/master/files/Academic_CV_ph.pdf" download> [click to download]</a> and publications. I will host my Job Market Paper here when the time comes. If anything on this website catches your interest, or if you would like to discuss any of the topics or texts on this website, feel free to get in touch. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching market power in digital markets and the role of Internet infrastructure.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about economics, crÃªpes recipes, places to go in Florence, Italy.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about competition law enforcement and the EU bubble in Brussels.
