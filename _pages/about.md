### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Philip Hanspach, a PhD economist and currently a junior economist at the OECD. I work in the team that updates and publishes the Product Market Regulation indicators, a flagship indicator published by the OECD's Economics Department. One key theme of my work is on competition-friendly regulation for energy markets, electronic communication, and digital markets. The other key theme is regulation of AI - pro-competitive, pro-innovation, international best practices and lessons learned.

My research interests are industrial organization, competition policy, and pricing algorithms. On this website, you can find my CV <a href="https://github.com/philiphanspach/philiphanspach.github.io/tree/master/files/Academic_CV_ph.pdf" download> [click to download]</a> and publications. This website hosts my publications or links to them.
