Take a look around. If anything catches your interest, or if you would like to discuss any of the topics or texts on this website, feel free to get in touch.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching market power in digital markets and the role of Internet infrastructure.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about economics, crÃªpes recipes, places to go in Florence, Italy.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about competition law enforcement and the EU bubble in Brussels.

## Current research

### Working paper: "Does buyer discretion facilitate home bias in procurement? Cross-border procurement of medical supplies under Covid-19"
Abstract: International public procurement sees low shares of cross-border purchases despite agreements against national preferencing. Introducing a unique dataset of contract awards for medical supplies in 27 European countries 2018 - 2020, we find a large, temporary surge in cross-border awards as the net effect of the Covid-19 pandemic and targeted deregulation. Two difference-in-differences regressions identify effects of crisis urgency and increased buyer discretion on cross-border procurement. The effects are economically large, as deregulation (a one-standard deviation increase in infection rates) increases the share of cross-border awards by 35.7 (19.3) percentage points over a baseline of 1.5 percent.
