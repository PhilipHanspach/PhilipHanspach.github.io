### Internet infrastructure and competition in digital markets
Abstract: Large platform companies increasingly integrate vertically by building Internet infrastructure. These investments enable new and tiered services while reducing dependence on third-party suppliers. I model competing investment incentives in Internet infrastructure for an upstream player and a large downstream platform facing small rival platforms without own infrastructure. Investment incentives increase discontinuously both upstream and downstream when the downstream platform has the larger infrastructure. The upstream player benefits from "commoditization" when it has the smaller network. I discuss the model implications for competition with small downstream platforms without proprietary infrastructure, network access regulation, and net neutrality. <a href="https://github.com/PhilipHanspach/philiphanspach.github.io/tree/master/files/infrastructure.pdf" download> First published October 30, 2022.

### Working paper: "Does buyer discretion facilitate home bias in procurement? Cross-border procurement of medical supplies under Covid-19"
Abstract: International public procurement sees low shares of cross-border purchases despite agreements against national preferencing. Introducing a unique dataset of contract awards for medical supplies in 27 European countries 2018 - 2020, we find a large, temporary surge in cross-border awards as the net effect of the Covid-19 pandemic and targeted deregulation. Two difference-in-differences regressions identify effects of crisis urgency and increased buyer discretion on cross-border procurement. The effects are economically large, as deregulation (a one-standard deviation increase in infection rates) increases the share of cross-border awards by 35.7 (19.3) percentage points over a baseline of 1.5 percent.

###  Working paper: "The European Internal Energy Market’s Worth to the UK"
with Farid Gasmi, TSE Working Paper, n° 19-1052, 11/2019. 

Abstract: This article proposes a two-country model of electricity trade under peak-load pricing. We apply the model to France and the UK to assess the benefit to the UK of trade within the European internal energy market (IEM). Calibration and simulations of the model aimed at simulating bilateral trade in the market coupling process at electricity exchanges show the following. First, the occurrence of gains from trade for both countries is highly dependent on whether imported electricity affects the price in the local market and whether imports alleviate scarcity. Second, the main effect of importing electricity is a shift in welfare from domestic producers to domestic consumers of the importing country. Finally, the UK’s membership in the IEM generates additional welfare for the UK of up to 900 M€ per year across a range of scenarios in which the number of on-peak periods are exogenously varied in a conservative way relative to the actual data.
